Daniel Mason Savvy Coders' Homework Repo

I am currently the first international, Canadian student to be enrolled the Savvy Coders' Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
This is a repo, I've created to upload any and all homework that I've completed from week to week.

My Goals for this course are to;
1)learn more about myself as a developer within a team and on my own.
2)become more proficient in the world of scrum while using an agile workflow as opposed to a waterfall methodology.
3)have more of a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals when it comes to git, github, JS, HTML, CSS, the M.E.R.N web development stack and everything else this bootcamp has to offer.
4)develop the proper habits going forward when it comes to using git and github with respect updating my own personal project, the capstone project while in this bootcamp, and anything that I end up working in the future.
5) learn how to work a as developer/scrum master within a team setting while using agile methodologies.
6) ease some of my own imposter syndrome.
7) become more comfortable on camera from class to class.
8) learn how to my work life balance.
9) unlearn all the bad habit I've picked up over the past year and half of self-learning.
10) have fun, while doing all of the above and making the most of it.
